#### **Session 1: Forecasting Feature, Bug Fixes, and UI Updates**

**Overview**

This session involved three main activities:
1.  Committing a major new forecasting feature to the remote Git repository.
2.  Diagnosing and fixing a bug in the `AnalysisModule.vue` component where a chart failed to render.
3.  Implementing a feature change in the `Navbar.vue` component to create a conditional navigation experience for logged-in users, which also involved a significant code refactor.

**1. Task: Commit and Push New Forecasting Feature**

-   **Objective:** The primary goal was to commit a large number of local changes, which constituted a new full-stack forecasting feature, and push them to the `origin/master` branch of the remote repository.
-   **How it was done:**
    1.  **Status Check:** I began by running `git status` and `git diff HEAD` to get a comprehensive overview of all local changes. This revealed numerous staged files and one unstaged file (`FinancialProjection.vue`) related to the new feature.
    2.  **Staging:** After you confirmed, I added the remaining unstaged file to the commit using `git add frontend/client/src/components/forecast/FinancialProjection.vue`.
    3.  **Commit Message:** I drafted a detailed commit message that summarized the extensive changes, covering the new backend API, frontend dashboard, charting libraries, and financial projection modules.
    4.  **Commit & Push:** Upon your approval, I executed the `git commit` command with the detailed message, followed by `git push origin master`. This successfully updated the remote repository with the new feature.

**2. Task: Bug Fix - Empty Monthly Sales Chart**

-   **Component:** `c:\Users\abhin\Desktop\soukarsh\metainflu\frontend\client\src\components\forecast\AnalysisModule.vue`
-   **Problem:** When viewing a multi-year analysis, the "Monthly Sales for [Year]" chart would appear empty after selecting a different year from either the year-summary chart or the new dropdown menu.
-   **How it was fixed:**
    1.  **Diagnosis:** I read the file and analyzed the component's script. The root cause was a **data type mismatch**. The `selectedYear` variable was being set to a `Number` when changed via the `<select>` dropdown, but the `monthlyDataByYear` `Map` that held the chart's data was keyed using `String`s (e.g., `"2023"`). When the code tried to get data using a number key (`map.get(2023)`), it found nothing and returned an empty array, causing the chart to be blank.
    2.  **Solution:** I standardized the data type for years to be `String` throughout the component.
        -   The `processedData.years` array is now explicitly converted to an array of strings (e.g., `["2022", "2023"]`).
        -   Code that filters data based on the year was updated to use `parseInt(year)` to correctly compare the string year with the number from the `Date` object.
        -   This ensures that whether the year is selected from the chart (which returns a string) or the dropdown, the lookup in the `monthlyDataByYear` map is always successful.

**3. Task: Feature Update - Conditional Navbar**

-   **Component:** `c:\Users\abhin\Desktop\soukarsh\metainflu\frontend\client\src\components\Navbar.vue`
-   **Objective:** To change the navigation links for logged-in users. The requirement was to only show a "Home" link when on the `/forecast-dashboard` page, and only a "Forecast" link when on the home page (`/`).
-   **How it was done:**
    1.  **Code Refactoring:** I first refactored the entire component from a mix of Vue's Options and Composition APIs to the modern `<script setup>` syntax. This improves code organization, readability, and aligns with current best practices for Vue 3.
    2.  **Route Detection:** I used the `useRoute` composable from `vue-router` to reactively track the user's current URL path.
    3.  **Conditional Logic:** I created two computed properties, `isForecastPage` and `isHomePage`, that return `true` or `false` based on the current path.
    4.  **Template Update:** In the `<template>`, I used these computed properties with `v-if` and `v-else-if` directives. The template now contains two distinct navigation structures:
        -   If the user is logged in (`globalState.isLoggedIn`), it shows only the "Home" or "Forecast" link based on the exclusive logic you requested.
        -   If the user is logged out, it continues to show the full list of public-facing links (Home, About, Services, etc.).
    This was applied to both the desktop and mobile navigation menus for a consistent experience.

#### **Session 2: Data Handling, UI Enhancements, and Transparency**

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Time:** 4:30 PM

This session focused on data handling, UI enhancements for data visualization, and improving user trust through transparency.

**1. Task: Create Test Data for Single-Year Sales**

-   **Objective:** To create a test case for single-year retail sales data to be used for testing the forecasting functionality.
-   **How it was done:**
    1.  **Directory Creation:** A new directory `backend/data` was created to store test data files.
    2.  **File Creation:** A new file `backend/data/retail_sales_test_data.csv` was created.
    3.  **Content:** The file was populated with 12 months of sample retail sales data, including `Date` and `Sales` columns. This provides a realistic test case for single-year analysis.

**2. Task: Enhance Single-Year Data Analysis View**

-   **Component:** `c:\Users\abhin\Desktop\soukarsh\metainflu\frontend\client\src\components\forecast\AnalysisModule.vue`
-   **Objective:** To provide more detailed analysis for single-year sales data by adding a trend chart.
-   **How it was done:**
    1.  **Chart Addition:** A new line chart for "Monthly Sales Trend" was added to the single-year view. This complements the existing bar chart for "Monthly Sales".
    2.  **Component Update:** The `<template>` was updated to include a new `div` for the line chart. The `<script setup>` was modified to initialize and update the new `echarts` instance for the line chart. The component now shows two charts for single-year data, providing a richer visualization.

**3. Task: Add Privacy Notice to Configuration Form**

-   **Component:** `c:\Users\abhin\Desktop\soukarsh\metainflu\frontend\client\src\components\forecast\ConfigForm.vue`
-   **Objective:** To increase transparency and user trust by adding a privacy notice to the data configuration form.
-   **How it was done:**
    1.  **Notice Addition:** A styled `div` containing the privacy notice was added to the bottom of the form, just before the closing `</form>` tag.
    2.  **Content:** The notice clarifies that user's sales data is processed on the server and not sent to external AI models, and that only anonymous context is used for macro adjustments.
